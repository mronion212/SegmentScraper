# SegmentScraper

SegmentScraper extracts intro, recap, and outro timestamps from supported streaming services. It includes automatic IMDb lookup, JSON export, and IntroDB submission with duplicate filtering.

## Supported Services

- Netflix
- Prime Video
- Videoland
- SkyShowtime (prepared; extraction mapping pending)

Disney+ and HBO Max are present in the provider configuration but do not yet have extraction modules.
SkyShowtime is registered in the userscript and displays the shared panel during playback; its network metadata still needs to be mapped before timestamps can be captured.

## Features

- Captures and normalizes provider-specific segment metadata
- Automatically looks up IMDb series IDs
- Exports captured timestamps as JSON
- Previews JSON before download
- Submits timestamps to IntroDB
- Removes segments already present in IntroDB from exports and submissions
- Uses one shared provider panel based on the Netflix layout

The panel layout, dimensions, typography, controls, counters, backgrounds, borders, and spacing are identical for every provider. A provider may only customize:

- Button colors
- Provider name and provider-name color
- Text above the JSON export
- Info-box text and accent color

## Architecture

The shared core handles state, IMDb lookup, IntroDB communication, export, duplicate filtering, and panel actions. Each active provider supplies only its detection, interception, extraction, and player-control integration.

Provider metadata is normalized into the common intro, recap, and outro format before it enters shared state. The Netflix panel is the visual source of truth, with sizing and native controls isolated from streaming-site CSS so Prime Video and Videoland render identically.

## Adding a Provider

1. Create `src/providers/{provider-name}/index.js`.
2. Create `src/providers/{provider-name}/extractor.js`.
3. Register the provider with the shared bootstrap.
4. Add its configuration to `src/config/provider-config.js`.
5. Add any required mappings to `src/normalization/segment-mapper.js`.
6. Add the provider modules to the bundler input list and add the required userscript `@match` entries.

New provider panels must retain the shared Netflix layout. Only the documented provider overrides may differ.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

The generated userscript is written to `SegmentScraper.user.js`.

## Usage

1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) or another compatible userscript manager.
2. Install the generated `SegmentScraper.user.js`.
3. Open a supported streaming service and start playback.
4. Open the SegmentScraper panel from the injected player button.
5. Set the IMDb ID if automatic lookup did not resolve it.
6. Download the JSON export, or save an IntroDB API key and submit directly.
